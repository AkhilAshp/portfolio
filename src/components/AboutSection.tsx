              I'm a passionate full-stack developer with a deep fascination for artificial intelligence 
              and machine learning. My journey in tech spans several years, during which I've honed my 
              skills in creating robust, scalable applications and exploring the frontiers of AI technology.

            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you'll find me experimenting with new AI models, contributing to open-source 
              projects, or sharing knowledge with the developer community. I believe in the power of technology 
              to solve real-world problems and create meaningful impact.
