              I'm passionate about software development and emerging technologies and a growing interest in Machine Learning and AI tools. 
              Beyond web technologies, I'm keen on exploring how AI can enhance applications and solve real-world problems.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              My goal is to bridge the gap between traditional development and intelligent 
              systems, leveraging both my coding skills and curiosity for emerging tech 
              to build impactful projects. I thrive on challenges and believe in continuous 
              learning through hands-on experience and collaboration. Whether working independently or as part of a team, 
              I'm driven by the excitement of turning ideas into innovative solutions.
